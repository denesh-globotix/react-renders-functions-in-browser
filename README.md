# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Commands:
npm start

## Explanation: 
Take notice that the function getData evaluates in your browser not in the place where npm start has been run. So say if this reactjs project has been hosted up in the cloud. It can be noticed that the public IP is still that of the browser. Does this mean that components are only evaluated in the browser and if so, how does the browser know how to make sense of th react components?
